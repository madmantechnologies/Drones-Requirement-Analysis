# Drones-Requirement-Analysis
Drone is something which you can see around you or on social media or in modern day festivals and weddings. The use of drone videography has become increasingly popular in event marketing, providing a unique and engaging way to gather video. However, the advantages of this technology go well beyond these industries. Drones are being used widely in various sectors for various purposes.  Drones are good fits for taking on some of the world's most difficult professions since they can be controlled remotely and flown at different distances and heights. Drone technology has been used by defense groups and tech-savvy individuals for quite some time. Many drones are intended specifically for surveillance in the defense sector. Surveillance drones integrated with heat sensors are being used to identify unusual forest temperatures in order to better monitor and battle forest fires. As a result, teams can identify locations prone to forest fires or spot flames mere minutes after they start. Drones play an important part in a variety of industries, including healthcare, waste management, energy, mining, infrastructure, urban planning, and many more.
